<small>英硕太快，怎么就要选论文题目了</small>

## Study

### School

1. [Dissertation]: We had a dissertation kick-off meeting this week. Every professor introduced their research topics for us to choose a suitable supervisor. I have decided to do an NLP-related project and find out how to fine-tune a specialized chatbot.

2. [Data Structure and Algorithm Module]: Finished the first quiz. This quiz involved binary search trees, AVL trees, along with time and space complexity analysis.

3. [SQL]: Basic SQL query language, grouping queries, and aggregate operators.

4. [Build a Usable Software]: Learned how to build a class diagram and a sequence diagram and distinguish different relationships between entities (Association, Aggregation, Dependence, Composition, Inheritance).

4. [Software 2]: Flask project architecture and some front-end topics.

### Personal

1. [Intelligent English-Scene Project]:
    - Improved prompts by listing more specific requirements and using the temperature parameter to make responses more creative, which better suits my project.
    - Integrated Google Text-to-Speech API. This API has a generous free limit.

2. [LeetCode]: Finished 7 questions. I was so busy last week—please forgive me. This week, I'll focus on dynamic programming.

3. [Java]:
    - Went through the tutorial document.
    - Found a good YouTube video about Spring and Spring Boot. Unlike other instructors, he doesn’t just teach APIs but explains key features of Spring Boot first.
    Dependency Injection (DI) is a key feature in Spring Boot. It’s similar to a Node.js project I built before, which used reflect-metadata for metadata programming. This concept is also similar to Reflection in Java. reflect-metadata enables DI, allowing us to use decorators to simplify functions. Decorators in JavaScript are similar to annotations in Java.
    I feel so pleased when I encounter similar concepts across different languages. I think this is the essence of programming—fundamental ideas for solving problems.

4. [Improve GitHub Home]:
    - A good home page improves first impressions.
    - Showcasing skills effectively is essential.

### Life and Holiday

Enjoyed a satisfying afternoon at a Japanese cake café.

## Thoughts

### Finished reading《A Moveable Feast》

Hemingway spent a poor but happy time in Paris. Throughout history, many writers and artists have embraced a poor yet fulfilling life. I’ve decided to live like a primitive person and build my own tribal rules.😄
